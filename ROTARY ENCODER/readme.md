# Volume Knob with Rotary encoder

In this project I have interfaced the Arduino uno with a rotary encoder and implemented a volume knob. The rotary encoder is a knob similar to a potentiometer but digital in function. It has 3 pins, the CLK, DT, SW. the CLK and DT pins are used to figure out the direction of rotation while the SW pin is to detect the pushbutton feature which can be activated by pushing down on the knob. 

## Components
